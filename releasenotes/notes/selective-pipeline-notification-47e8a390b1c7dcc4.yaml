    The notification-agent can now be configured to either build meters or
    events. By default, the notification agent will continue to load both
    pipelines and build both data models. To selectively enable a pipeline,
    configure the `pipelines` option under the `[notification]` section.

    Addition pipelines can be created following the format used by existing
    pipelines.
