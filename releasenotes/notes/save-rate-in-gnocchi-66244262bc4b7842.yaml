features:
  - |
    Archive policies can now be configured per metrics in gnocchi_resources.yaml.
    A default list of archive policies is now created by Ceilometer.
    They are called "ceilometer-low-rate" for all IOs metrics and "ceilometer-low"
    for others.
upgrade:
  - |
    Ceilometer now creates it own archive policies in Gnocchi and use them to
    create metrics in Gnocchi. Old metrics kept their current archive policies
    and will not be updated with ceilometer-upgrade. Only newly created metrics
    will be impacted. Archive policy can still be overridden with the publisher url
    (e.g: gnocchi://archive_policy=high).
deprecations:
  - |
    cpu_util and \*.rate meters are deprecated and will be removed in future
    release in favor of the Gnocchi rate calculation equivalent.
