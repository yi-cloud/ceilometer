deprecations:
  - |
    Usage of transformers in Ceilometer pipelines is deprecated. Transformers in Ceilometer
    have never computed samples correctly when you have multiple workers. This functionality can
    be done by the storage backend easily without all issues that Ceilometer has. For example, the
    rating is already computed in Gnocchi today.
  - |
    Pipeline Partitioning is also deprecated. This was only useful to
    workaround of some issues that tranformers has.
