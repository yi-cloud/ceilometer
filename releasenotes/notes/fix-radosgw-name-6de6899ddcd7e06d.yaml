upgrade:
  - |
    Use `radosgw.*` to enable/disable radosgw meters explicitly rather than
    `rgw.*`
deprecations:
  - |
    Previously, to enable/disable radosgw.* meters, you must define entry_point
    name rather than meter name. This is corrected so you do not need to be
    aware of entry_point naming. Use `radosgw.*` to enable/disable radosgw
    meters explicitly rather than `rgw.*`. `rgw.*` support is deprecated
    and will be removed in Rocky.
fixes:
  - |
    Fix ability to enable/disable radosgw.* meters explicitly
