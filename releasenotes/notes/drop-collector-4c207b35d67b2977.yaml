    The collector service is removed. From Ocata, it's possible to edit the
    pipeline.yaml and event_pipeline.yaml files and modify the publisher to
    provide the same functionality as collector dispatcher. You may change
    publisher to 'gnocchi', 'http', 'panko', or any combination of available
    publishers listed in documentation.
