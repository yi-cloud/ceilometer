    The Gnocchi dispatcher has been removed and replaced by a native Gnocchi
    publisher. The configuration options from the `[dispatcher_gnocchi]` has
    been removed and should be passed via the URL in `pipeline.yaml`. The
    service authentication override can be done by adding specific credentials
    to a `[gnocchi]` section instead.
