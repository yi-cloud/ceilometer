features:
  - |
    Workload partitioning of notification agent is now split into queues
    based on pipeline type (sample, event, etc...) rather than per individual
    pipeline. This will save some memory usage specifically for pipeline
    definitions with many source/sink combinations.
upgrade:
  - |
    If workload partitioning of the notification agent is enabled, the
    notification agent should not run alongside pre-Queens agents. Doing so
    may result in missed samples when leveraging transformations. To upgrade
    without loss of data, set `notification_control_exchanges` option to
    empty so only existing `ceilometer-pipe-*` queues are processed. Once
    cleared, reset `notification_control_exchanges` option and launch the new
    notification agent(s). If `workload_partitioning` is not enabled, no
    special steps are required.
